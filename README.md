# Marnie Bot 

Marnie Bot is a Discord bot that allows you to fetch data on Pokemon.

Feel free to clone the source code to set up your own version of the bot.

The bot scrapes PokeAPI data to provide updated information on Pokemon Base Stat Totals. Useful if you have a Discord Server
based around Pokemon Showdown, and you want your own lightweight port of the website's commands.
