# Marnie Bot 

Marnie Bot is a Discord bot that allows you to fetch data on Pokemon. No vibe coding was used in this project.

Feel free to clone the source code to set up your own version of the bot.

The bot scrapes PokeAPI data to provide updated information on Pokemon Base Stat Totals. Useful if you have a Discord Server
based around Pokemon Showdown, and you want your own lightweight port of the website's commands.

## Installation

Feel free to install her at this [link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1455036822014001168&permissions=68608&integration_type=0&scope=bot).

Or, alternatively, if you desire to host an instance of herself to customize her to your liking, do:

```
docker build -t marnie .
```

```
docker run marnie
```

Don't be silly and commit your .env publicly!
